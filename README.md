### 5 Basic Model Oganisation

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Naming our objects
2. Using collections
3. Organisation is down to you
4. Join individual mesh objects into one


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Understand that naming and organisation might not seem important with smaller files but it is critical in larger ones


### 6 The Boolean Modifier

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use our first modifier

### 12 Material Quick Tip: Base Colour

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Applied your first material
2. Understand many objects can share the same material
3. Base colour only scratches the surface of a materials properties


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
